# Jekyll configuration for Open SDG platform

# Doing the Quick start? Here are the settings to update during installation:
#
# Replace the baseurl with the name of this repository. For example, if the repository is named
# "my-site-repository", then update the baseurl like so:
# baseurl: "/my-site-repository"
baseurl: "/sdg-sandbox-indicators"
# The next line should be the URL of your data repository published site. To find this,
# go to your data repository in Github, and click "Settings", then scroll down to the
# "Github Pages" section. Copy/paste the link in the green section.

# That's enough for the Quick Start! The remaining settings can be configured later.

# Tell the Remote Theme plugin to use the Open SDG platform (Jekyll theme).
remote_theme: open-sdg/open-sdg@1.4.0-dev

url: ""
environment: staging
